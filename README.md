Here are the steps we followed:
Ran a screaming frog test, downloaded the files and pulled H1’s from the sheet. Screaming Frog is an SEO tool that provides different metrics such meta titles, H1’s, status code etc.
Took each of the H1’s and ran keyword research on SEMrush and pulled the metrics such as top 20 SERP results, its page authority, backlinks, total no. of keywords, referring domains and page type.
Sent the list of CSVs to Ramesh to pull off rest of the data.
Note: here H1’s are our target keywords.
